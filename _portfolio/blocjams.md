## Explanation

BlocJams is the first project I participated in. It was built with vanilla JS and refactored to use jQuery. The idea was a basic music streaming site. It lists albums, and then a song list inside the album. The user can select a song to play, then interact using the play/pause, next, previous, volume, mute, and song position slider.


## Problem

There were lots of “problems” on this build, but that was expected since this was my first real exposure to the world of web development. The steps take to move my knowledge of basic JS and HTML into a practical application were frustrating and fulfilling at the same time. The real frustrations came from tying all the little parts I learned from coding lessons into a working app.

## Solution

Once the basic understanding of how HTML, JS (later jQuery), and a multi-file application work clicked, I was able to build out the features listed above. Pieces start to fall into place at each small victory, the sense of accomplishment is motivating, while at the same time I only become more overwhelmed as the scope of what I don’t understand becomes apparent. Maintaining focus on getting the next small piece to work, and using mental blinders to avoid any unhelpful frustration was the key to success.

## Results

Well, it works. There is only one album, but it is listing it multiple times by design to fill the album page. I have songs in the album, and they play. All the button functions work as intended. What more do I want… more albums and songs, but that’s not the point. The goals have been met and it’s time to move to the next adventure.

## Conclusion

This project delivered a needed boost to my confidence along with multitudinous hours of frustration. There is absolutely unmeasurable value in the experience gained from putting all these little pieces I learned from lessons on JS/HTML/Git/etc. Lessons are great, but they never really combine the point of each part and their interrelation to get the whole project to work.
