## Explanation

Cryptic Post is a site loosely based on the “Reddit” format. It is a place for users to post/collaborate/and engage. This also features the ability to favorite threads. you want to stay updated on.

## Problem

Creating the site was an interesting adventure into some neat features that are more complex than they appear to be on the surface. Getting the voting feature working (looking) as intended was one of the more challenging aspects of the build.

## Solution

There was a lot of trial and error getting the features and layout to cooperate. But the end solution on this project was “Tenacity”! Keep working at it, keep playing and adjusting and tweaking, and keep motivated.

## Results

I am pretty happy with how this turned out in the end. There are a few things that I would like to have cleaned up/added/changed. But perspective is really needed on these projects. I am using them to learn in-order to reach a goal. I could nit pick for days getting it working exactly right, but there is little gain, as I have to move to the next project.

## Conclusion

I let you draw your own conclusion.
